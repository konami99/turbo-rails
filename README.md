# Turbo Rails
[Turbo Rails](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails) is a fantastic tutorial for learning Hotwire. I often found myself returning to it to refresh my knowledge. However, the absence of source code makes it challenging for me to advance to the later chapters. So I spent a couple of days following the tutorial and reproduced the Quote Editor app.
